# Super Resolution & Image Inpainting

### Purpose of this project
* Learn about Convolutional Neural Networks
* Discover the intracacies of training large neurla nets
* Learn about state of the art approaches to image restoration techniques

#### Notes:
    For a more indepth explaination of my implementations of these neural networks visit my other Github pages.
  * [SuperResolution](https://github.com/JoshVEvans/Super-Resolution)


## 1. Super Resolution
I took inspiration from [SRCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00092.pdf)
