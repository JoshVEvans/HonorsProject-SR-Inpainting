# Super Resolution & Image Inpainting

### Purpose of this project
* Learn about Convolutional Neural Networks
* Discover the intracacies of training large neurla nets
* Learn about state of the art approaches to image restoration techniques

#### Notes:
For a more indepth explaination of my implementations of these neural networks visit my other Github pages.

## 1. Super Resolution
I took inspiration from and implemented [SRCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00092.pdf) and [VDSR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04587.pdf). My final model is based on a [RESNET](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) style architecture.
